/* 
Sample json file with desriptions 
Must be named with a .json extension.  File name doesn't matter.  
All module files get overwritten each time, so if you want to add fights to an existing zone, create a new file with the same map id, or send info to me and I'll add it.  https://github.com/manlaan/BlishHud-HPGrid   -   manlaan@hotmail.com
